# Project Overview

Welcome, code enthusiasts, to our realm of fun and knowledge - Quiz Dev! 

This is not just your typical quiz app; this is a trivia battleground, designed exclusively for the wizards of programming, where your knowledge is your weapon, and your quick wit, your shield.

Quiz Dev is more than a game, it's a learning tool that lets you strengthen and broaden your programming knowledge. The topics? Only the finest selection of programming-related curiosities, of course! 

## Main Features

- **Global Competitions:** Step into our global arena where programmers from around the world gather to test their knowledge. Here, borders blur, and only your skills matter.

- **Learn and Grow:** By using 'CodeQuiz', you don't just play, you learn. With a vast array of questions covering numerous programming topics, every new game is a chance to learn something new. 

- **Engage in Battle:** Want to challenge a friend or coworker? Our app allows for exciting head-to-head battles where only the most knowledgeable coder will prevail.

So come and join us in this exciting journey, where coding and quizzing blend to create a perfect symphony of fun and learning.

As of the latest update, our 'DevQuiz' project is approximately 40% complete in terms of mobile application UI development. We've been tirelessly piecing together an attractive and user-friendly interface that encapsulates our vision of merging knowledge acquisition with a sense of fun and competition.

Even though we're proud to say "Progress is a tasty dish!", we acknowledge that patience is not always an easy virtue. The idea of quizzing, learning, and earning bragging rights among your fellow coding companions is too exciting! That's why our dedicated team of designers and developers are working around the clock (with essential coffee breaks, of course) to deliver a finished product that you'll love.

In the meantime, take a look at the neat little gif above for a sneak peek of 'DevQuiz'. Consider it an appetizer before we serve the main course - a robust, engaging, and knowledge-packed quiz app.

## Project Roadmap

For 'DevQuiz' to reach its full potential and transform into the majestic coding quiz master we envision, here's a list of the remaining milestones we need to hit:

1. **Complete the UI for the Mobile App:** Our app should not only function excellently but also look fantastic. The remaining 60% of the UI work will involve refining the existing interfaces, adding missing screens, and optimizing for different device resolutions.

2. **Complete the App Logic:** We've laid down the fundamental blocks for the app's logic, but there's more to be done. This includes setting up the quiz mechanics, matchmaking logic, scoring systems, and more. 

3. **i18next Translation:** To make DevQuiz accessible to everyone, we're cooking up translations using i18next. We believe in "code without borders"!

4. **Develop the Backend and CMS using Django:** An app like 'DevQuiz' requires a robust backend and CMS. Our choice is Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The backend will handle data management, user authentication, and other server-side operations. The CMS will allow us to manage quiz questions, user data, and more.

5. **Testing:** We're devoted to quality and user experience, which means rigorous testing is crucial. We'll test the app on different devices, under various scenarios, and against all possible edge cases to ensure a smooth user experience. 

6. **Code Refactoring:** Good code is like good humor - timing is everything. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we'll revisit and refactor our codebase regularly to keep it clean, efficient, and easy-to-understand for anyone who might want to contribute or just have a peek. 

7. **Documentation:** Let's face it, nobody likes a project that's harder to understand than hieroglyphics. That's why we're committed to documenting all features, fixes, and foibles thoroughly.

The DevQuiz journey is an exciting one, and we can't wait to share each milestone with our community.
